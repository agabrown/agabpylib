"""
Star cluster simulation tools.

This package provides functions for simple simulations of star clusters.

The cluster simulations are focused on generating realistic observables and are NOT intended for the simulation of
dynamically self-consistent clusters (i.e. where the mass distribution, potential, and kinematics are consistent).
