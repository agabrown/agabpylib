Metropolis samplers
-------------------

Detailed API: :py:mod:`agabpylib.mcmc.metropolis`

This module was started as part of following the exercises on MCMC samplers in
`Hogg & Foreman-Mackey (2017) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06068>`_. It is only intended
as a learning exercise. For actual MCMC applications proper samplers should
be used such as `Stan <https://mc-stan.org>`_, `emcee <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`_, 
or `PyMC <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc>`_.
